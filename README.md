This ia a repo for my lab 5 work

This code was made by cloning the repo shown in class.

https://esausilva.com/2017/11/14/how-to-use-create-react-app-with-a-node-express-backend-api/

It made it so we can make the client and server run at the same time.

Also Adina from our class was very helpful in helping me to figure out how to connect to the backend.

## dependencies
Axios, cors, express, sqlite3, react, react0dom, react-router-dom, http-proxy-middleware and body-parser

These dependencies seem to need to be installed in both the root folder and the client folder 

It is also possible that not all of these are needed as I did add modules to try and fix various problems.

# running the code

After cloning the repo and installing the dependencies to run the front end you need to type
` yarn dev `

in the root directory

Then the backend and frontend will start to run
