# Storyboard of Front End

My website has 4 pages and so 4 paths a user can go down

# Home page

The landing page of my site is called the home page.

I did not put any functionality here.
I just used it to make sure it was working.

The explination of the site and data could be put here.

# Register Page

This is the page where the user can register a car into the database.

It has a form where you input the data that is beong asked for.

After hitting the submit button the database will be updated with the entry.

I tried to ask for the info that the owner of the car would have to fill out in a real car show.


# Search page

This page regularly displays all the cars in the database

It also has a form where you can enter in some data to restrict the results that show up

It also has a label for each of the fields being displayed



# Upodate page

This is the page where the user can update the page

There is a form that aks for the CAR ID since that is what will be used to update the car data.

It then has fields for you to enter the score and ranking

I selected these two values because it simulates the judges entering in the info after judging the car.

hitting the update button will update the car with the car id entered in the database.
